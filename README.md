# Return Potion

**This project is inspired by Terraria and my favorite RU server - [Luminto](https://t.me/lumintomc)!**

About the potion: You can get it by right-clicking on the portal of the End. You will be charged 8 (config value) experience points, and you will receive it.
You can also craft a return potion:
